    <body>

    <p>Dolphins live in a variety of habitats, from coastal waters to the open ocean.</p>

    <p>Bottlenose Dolphins  typically swim in either coastal and offshore ecosystems.</p>

    <p>In general, the coastal Dolphins are adapted for warm, shallow waters.</p>

    <p>Offshore dolphins are adapted for cooler, deeper waters.  They are better suited for deep diving. Their larger body helps to conserve heat and defend itself against predators.</p>
