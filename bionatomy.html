        <h1>Biology</h1>
        <h2>Anatomy</h2>
        <p>
            Dolphins have torpedo shaped bodies with generally non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers,
            non-existent external ear flaps, a tail fin, and bulbous heads. Dolphin skulls have small eye orbits,
            long snouts, and eyes placed on the sides of its head. Dolphins range in size from the 1.7 metres (5.6 ft)
            long and 50 kilograms (110 lb) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 metres (31 ft) and 10 metric tons (11 short tons)
            killer whale. Overall, however, they tend to be dwarfed by other Cetartiodactyls. Several species have
            female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males.

            Dolphins have conical shape teeth, as opposed to their counterparts, porpoise's, spade-shaped teeth.
            These conical teeth are used to catch swift prey such as fish, squid or large mammals, such as seal.

            Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by
            inhaling fresh air into the lungs, however this only occurs in the polar regions of the oceans. Dolphins
            have rather small, unidentifiable spouts.

            All dolphins have a thick layer of blubber, thickness varying on climate. This blubber can help with
            buoyancy, protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of
            fat, and energy for leaner times; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate.
            Calves, generally, are born with a thin layer of blubber, which develops at different paces depending on
            the habitat.

            Dolphins have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to terrestrial carnivores.
            They have fundic and pyloric chambers.

        <h2>Locomotion</h2>
        <p>
            Dolphins have two flippers on the underside toward the head, a dorsal fin and a tail fin. These flippers
            contain four digits. Although dolphins do not possess fully developed hind limbs, some possess discrete
            rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. Dolphins are fast swimmers in comparison to
            seals who typically cruise at 9–28 kilometres per hour (5.6–17.4 mph); the killer whale, in comparison,
            can travel at speeds up to 55.5 kilometres per hour (34.5 mph). The fusing of the neck vertebrae, while
            increasing stability when swimming at high speeds, decreases flexibility, which means they are unable to
            turn their heads. River dolphins, however, have non-fused neck vertebrae and are able to turn their
            head up to 90°. Dolphins swim by moving their tail fin and rear body vertically, while their flippers
            are mainly used for steering. Some species log out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster.
            Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. All species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves
            from involuntarily spinning in the water.

            Some dolphins are adapted for diving to great depths. In addition to their streamlined bodies, some can
            slow their heart rate to conserve oxygen. Some can also re-route blood from tissue tolerant of water
            pressure to the heart, brain and other organs. Their hemoglobin and myoglobin store oxygen in body tissues
            and they have twice the concentration of myoglobin than hemoglobin.
